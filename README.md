# prompt2query
prompt2query is a prompt-guided framework that helps researchers generate reproducible, database-ready search strategies for systematic reviews using ChatGPT.
It uses a two-part prompt template that separates expert-defined search rules from user-supplied keywords, enabling non-specialist users to convert free-text and controlled vocabulary terms into structured Boolean queries for PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Guidance on running searches, exporting results, de-duplication, and screening preparation is also included.
This repository contains the complete prompt template, supporting materials, and the Accepted Manuscript of the associated tutorial article.
